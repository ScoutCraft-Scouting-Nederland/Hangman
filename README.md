# Hangman
Hangman is a minigame where players have to guess words in a limited amount of turns. ScoutCraft had it running in their lobbies to have some entertainment.

It officially supports up to paper 1.18.2

This plugin was part of the [ScoutCraft project](https://github.com/ScoutCraft-Scouting-Nederland), which was the Minecraft server for Dutch scouts during the Corona pandemic.

## Features
* Let multiple players team up to play one game
* A visual representation of how many guesses are done with a new stage after every guess
* Efficient and without only one dependency!
